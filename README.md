# itsgonnarain-stevereich
An exploration into phase/systems music, recreating Steve Reich's It's Gonna Rain

In the project directory, you can run:
## lite-server

You should now be able to open http://localhost:3000 in a web browser to load the project (or it may already have opened automatically for you!).

Click the button to begin and sit back, relax(?) and vibe out to some good ol' phase music inspired by Mr. Reich himself!
